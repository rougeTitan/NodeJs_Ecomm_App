## üìù **Medium Description (Portfolio/LinkedIn)**

This project is a complete e-commerce platform developed using modern web technologies and best practices. The application provides a seamless shopping experience with secure user authentication, dynamic product catalog, shopping cart management, and integrated payment processing through Stripe. 

Built with Node.js and Express.js on the backend, the application uses MongoDB for data persistence and EJS for server-side rendering. Security is a primary focus, implementing CSRF protection, input validation, password hashing with bcryptjs, and comprehensive error handling. The platform includes an admin panel for product management, automated email notifications via SendGrid, PDF invoice generation, and SSL/HTTPS support for secure connections.

The project showcases professional development practices including MVC architecture, RESTful API design, middleware-based request processing, session management, file upload handling, and production optimization features like response compression and request logging.
